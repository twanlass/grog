CAPTAIN'S LOG
=============

2025-12-31 | Fix health bars and patrol route behavior
------------------------------------------------------
### Fixed
- Health bars now show correctly on attacked towers, ports, and settlements
- Patrol route uses ship's current destination as first waypoint instead of current position


2025-12-31 | Add AI opponent for versus mode
--------------------------------------------
### New
- AI opponent system - builds ships, ports, settlements, towers like a player
- "Versus AI" game mode with mirror start and total elimination win condition
- Entity ownership system (`owner` field distinguishes player vs AI units)
- AI decision engine with strategic priorities, build evaluation, and ship commands
- AI documentation (docs/features/ai-opponent.md)

### Improved
- Combat system is now owner-aware (no friendly fire, faction-based targeting)
- Ships can attack AI structures (ports, settlements, towers) using `attackDistance`
- Added `attackDistance` property to all ships for data-driven attack range

- Red visual indicators distinguish AI-owned units

### Fixed
- Ships now properly navigate to water tiles when attacking inland structures

### New
