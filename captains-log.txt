CAPTAIN'S LOG
=============

2026-01-03 | Add multi-port build hotkey with round-robin
----------------------------------------------------------
### New
- Multi-port ship building: select multiple ports and press C to queue ships

2026-01-03 | Fix patrol routes and add build queue
--------------------------------------------------
### New
- Build queue system for ports (max 3 ships per queue)

- Click-to-cancel on queue items with red X hover indicator

### Improved
- Player ships now auto-return-fire when attacked by AI players (not just pirates)

### Fixed
- Patrol routes now work correctly for multiple selected ships

----------------------------------------
### New

- Debug buttons on versus mode card to test specific AI strategies

### Improved
- Strategy-specific build priorities (towers, settlements, ships)
- Strategy-specific ship behavior (patrol radius, aggression)
- AI decisions now evolve based on game phase


2026-01-01 | Add retro square particles and hexagonal water effects
-------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------
### New
- Circular minimap in bottom-right corner showing fog of war state

2025-12-31 | Fix health bars and patrol route behavior
