### Misc improvement ideas
- build queue: allow ports to build multiple ships one after the other
- cursor upgrades: show hand when spacebar pressed; show sword when cmd click on ship
- show some impact dust when a cannon ball hits it's target 
- when multiple ports are selected, allow C hotkey to build muliple ships
- Shipyard upgrade: build two ships at once; queue up ship builds too. only consume resources at time of build if queued. 
- Shipyard upgrade should increase crew cap


### Bugs
- buildings that take damange while repairing should just deduct the damage from repair progress (right now they will repair but not all the way lol)


### Defend Mode notes 
- Upgrading towers is too easy / fast
- Need a few different pirate units for sure!

- - only attack settlements
- - attack in groups vs flank
- - rertreat when at 25% health. 

### Raid Mode notes 
- play as pirates? 
- starting: home port, settlements, a tower
- show a 

### Multiplayer Mode notes

- winds that speed up play
- attack bonuses 
- "stim packs" for ships (runes/ability tiles you charge and activiate)
- Rival AI trading companies
- Historical events
- Volcanoes!
