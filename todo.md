# Grog - Development Progress

## MVP Scope

### Core Systems
- [ ]

### Misc Ideas
- [ ] fix screen edge camera panning (once cursor exits window stop scrolling) 
- [ ] birds should be affected by speed mode (fly faster/slower etc)
- [ ] don't allow multiple things to be built on a single hex lol
- [ ] build queue: allow ports to build multiple ships one after the other
- [ ] shift+control left click to create a waypoint path for the selected ship. 
-- [ ] once working ^, start w/ P hotkey to create a patrol route 
- [ ] future: dynamic fog of war (hide again as units move away / destroyed)
- [ ] cursor upgrades: show hand when spacebar pressed; show sword when cmd click on ship
- [ ] don't render waves at edge of world
- [ ] show some impact dust when a cannon ball hits it's target 
- [ ] when multiple ports are selected, allow C hotkey to build muliple ships
- [ ] Shipyard upgrade: build two ships at once; queue up ship builds too. only consume resources at time of build if queued. 


### Bugs
- [ ] buildings that take damange while repairing should just deduct the damage from repair progress (right now they will repair but not all the way lol)
- [ ]  dont allow ports to build more than 1 tower at at time
- [ ] Patrol: 
- - [ ] can't multi-unit set patrol route
- - [ ] can't select a ship and break it from attack while on patrol route (should become player owned again)


### Defend Mode notes 
- [ ] Upgrading towers is too easy / fast
- [ ] Need a few different pirate units for sure!
- - [ ] Longer range, nets to slow ships down, faster smaller units, etc 
- [ ] add some different AI stratgies: bezerk focus on port, only attack settlements, attack in groups vs flank, rertreat when at 25% health. 


## Ideas
- Manual ship combat mini-game
- Named captains with skills
- Weather/seasons affecting routes
- Rival AI trading companies
- Historical events
- Volcanoes!
