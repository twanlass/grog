### Next
- Tune fog of war distnaces
- Tune attack distances (can't attack final settlements w/ biggest ship)
- Surrender mode from AI when just settlements is left?
- Have all ports contribute to global resources? 
- - what to do w/ trade route stuff? 
- minimap: show pulsing red x if any of your structures are being attacked and you're not there to see it (maybe check camera bounds?)
- Do ships on patrol attack structures? 
- FUN PASS! Add clouds, bird flocks, fish! etc


### UI nits
- unit selected panels: polish up
- port selected: show unit name "Dock" at top
- add tooltips to units, upgrades


### Misc improvement ideas
- build queue: allow ports to build multiple ships one after the other
- cursor upgrades: show hand when spacebar pressed; show sword when cmd click on ship
- show some impact dust when a cannon ball hits it's target 
- when multiple ports are selected, allow C hotkey to build muliple ships
- Shipyard upgrade: build two ships at once; queue up ship builds too. only consume resources at time of build if queued. 
- Shipyard upgrade should increase crew cap
- Towers: scout, guard, cannon -> guard shoots arrows at ships? Maybe path upgrade for fire arrows? 
- Pirates in VS mode: have them come to ports and plunder (steal resources) and not attack by default 
- P > click on island > auto-create route to circumnavigate the island!


### Bugs
- buildings that take damange while repairing should just deduct the damage from repair progress (right now they will repair but not all the way lol)
- towers, built from a port, should only be able to be built on current connected land /island like settelments


### Defend Mode notes 
- Upgrading towers is too easy / fast
- Need a few different pirate units for sure!
- - Longer range, nets to slow ships down, faster smaller units, etc 
- add some different AI stratgies: 
- - bezerk focus on port 
- - only attack settlements
- - attack in groups vs flank
- - rertreat when at 25% health. 

### Raid Mode notes 
- play as pirates? 
- starting: home port, settlements, a tower
- show a 

### VS Mode notes 
- when attacking an AI ship or structure, AI should be alerted and send ships to rescue
- fog of war should not reveal AI player at start
- end game: when all AI ports and ships are destroyed, have them surrender 
- setup simple sandbox to test out different AI strategies (economy, military, etc)
- Ensure AI can use upgrade paths and repair paths (have not see a tower)
- Strategy types: 
- - Rush (build ships, attack asap)
- - Mount (build a large ecnomoy, large army, then attack)
- - Turtle (build lots of defenses)
- - Sub strategy: Scout (send a ship to reaveal player position)


## Big Ideas
- Manual ship combat mini-game
- Named captains with skills
- Weather/seasons affecting routes
- whirlpoool that sucks in ships
- winds that speed up play
- attack bonuses 
- "stim packs" for ships (runes/ability tiles you charge and activiate)
- Rival AI trading companies
- Historical events
- Volcanoes!
